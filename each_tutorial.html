    <p>In this problem, you need to find out if you can divide a given number into two even parts. The parts need not be equal, just eligible to be divided into two <em>even</em> parts. For example, if the number is 4, you need to print "YES". If it is 6, you need to print "YES". If it is 2, you need to print "NO", and if it is 3, you print "NO".</p>
    <div class="code">
        w = int(input() <br>

        if w % 2 == 0 and w != 2: <br>
        &emsp;print("YES") <br>
        else: <br>
        &emsp;print("NO") <br>

    <h1>Way too long words: <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A">link to the problem</a></h1>
    <p>In this problem, you're asked to shorten words that have more than 10 characters like this: "information" should be shortened down to "i9n", which means that there are 9 letters in between "i" and "n" excluding the two. Words that have 10 characters and below should be left alone, so, "hello" should remain "hello" in the output.</p>
    <p>The first line of the input is a number that is the number that is the number of iterations the input should be asked. For example, if the first line of the input is <em>2</em>, then you will be asked for a word <em>two</em> times.</p>
    <p>Then, the user should be asked for a word for the specified number of times. After every iteration, the output must be the word, either shortened (if the word has more than 10 characters) or not shortened (if the word has 10 or less number of characters).</p>
    <div class="code">
        t = int(input()) <br>

    <h1>Team: <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A">link to the problem</a></h1>
    <p>Here, there are three friends who decide to take part in a competetive programming competition. These three, Petya, Vasya, and Tonya, form a team. They decide that, if less than two of them knows the answer to the given problem, then they will not attempt it. If two or more of the three know how to solve the problem, they would solve it.</p>
    <p>The first line of the input is the number of questions there are going to be in the competition. If the number of questions is 3, then the user will be asked for input three times.</p>
    <p>The next line(s) are the statements. The syntax of the statements is as follows:</p>
    <p>The first number in the statement will be Petya's: if Petya is sure she knows the answer, this will be 1. If not, it'll be 0.</p>
    <p>The second number in the statement is be Vasya's: if she's sure she knows the answer, this will be 1. If not, it'll be 0.</p>
    <p>The third number in the statement will be Tonya's: if she is sure she knows the answer, this will be 1. If not, it'll be 0.</p>
    <p>The output should be the number of questions in the competition that they will solve.</p>
