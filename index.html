    <h1>How to find an easy codeforces problem</h1>
    <p>You can find a list of Codeforces problems in ascending order of their difficulty by doing the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Head over to <a href="https://codeforces.com/">https://codeforces.com/</a></li>
            <li>Then, clicking on "Problemset", the sixth link in the top navigation bar</li>
            <li>There, in the third column showing numbers like "2800", "2400", and "2600", look at the yellow lightning bolt on top which is the head of the table column.</li>
            <li>Click on the arrow on the right of the yellow lightning bolt. Now, the list is in descending order of difficulty.</li>
            <li>To see the problems in ascending order of difficulty, click on the arrow on the left of the yellow lightning bolt again.</li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <h1>Format of a codeforces problem</h1>
    There is a lot of syntax in a codeforces problem. The syntax is as follows:

    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>The first line of the problem is the title of the problem.</li>
            <li>Under the title is the time limit per test. This is the maximum amount of time your code should take to run. For simpler questions, this shouldn't be a problem, but for more complex problems, you need to focus on efficiency.</li>
            <li>Next comes the memory limit. This is the maximum amount of memory in the computer that your code can take. Avoid using many var</li>
            <li>Then there is the statement of the problem. It is usually a story or a description of the inputs and outputs in a creative manner.</li>
            <li>Then comes the input. This tells you what the input is going to be.</li>
            <li>Next up is the output. This tells you what the output for the input mentioned above is going to be.</li>
            <li>Then there will be one or a few examples of inputs and expected outputs.</li>
            <li>Usually, there will be a note under the examples. Read it carefully because it may contain useful information.</li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <h1>How to submit a codeforces problem</h1>
    <p>To submit a codeforces problem, you need to do the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Scroll down a bit and look in the right column. Yould find a card with the title "â†’ Submit?"</li>
            <li>There, choose the language you're writing your code in in the language dropdown. You will usually need "Python 3.8.10"</li>
            <li>Then, you need to submit your code in a file. Click the "Choose file" button and search your file system for the file you wrote your code in.</li>
            <li>Click submit.</li>
            <li>You'll be redirected to a page where it shows all the records of all your submissions. The topmost is the one you just submitted. If it say "Accepted", then your code was correct. If it shows "Compilation error" or "Wrong answer on test <em>x</em>", you've made a mistake somewhere. You can click the number of your submission (the leftmost column in the table) to look at your submitted code, the error that the compiler encountered, and, (if the problem was not syntax-related and logic-related), the test case at which your code failed. You can look at all the test cases and find out what the problem was.</li>
            <li>Note: If the verdict is stuck at "running" or something similar, just refresh the page.</li>
        </ol>
